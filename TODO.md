V refactor location service - utilize observables to subscribe from local storage [http://plnkr.co/edit/TiUasGdutCsll1nI6USC?p=preview]
* extract map to a standalone component
* setup test + instructions
* update README file on github:
    - roadmap: - make a generic modal-shell component
    - roadmap: - input validation of lat, lng
    - roadmap: - create custom input component/pipe for lat/lng

disclaimers:
 * refresh (f5) route - always go to default: doesn't seem conventional. would implement using guard if really required
* styling - took a bit of freedom..
* roadmap
